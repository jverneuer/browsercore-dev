 * own copy. Every consumer now gets the same reporters (`text`, `html`,
 * `json-summary` — the last is what the coverage gate reads), the same v8
 * coverage over `src/` (all `.ts` files), the same 30s timeouts, and `globals: false`.
 *
 * Consumers opt in with just their name:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { definePackageConfig } from "@browsercore/dev/vitest";
 * export default definePackageConfig({ name: "crypto" });
 * ```
